[It should give two lines of output; the two lines should be identical, and
should be lined up one over the other.

Anything with O in it means newline is not coming through as ten on input.
LK means newline input is working fine, and EOF leaves the cell unchanged
(which I recommend).
LB means newline input is working fine, and EOF translates as 0.
LA means newline input is working fine, and EOF translates as -1.
Anything else is fairly unexpected.]
